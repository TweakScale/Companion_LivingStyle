# TweakScale Companion :: Living Style :: Changes

* 2025-0207: 0.0.3.1 (LisiasT) for KSP >= 1.2.2
	+ Adds support for [SSPXr](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/170211-*/)
	+ Updating the add'ons nomenclature to cope with [Abbreviations for Add'Ons](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/194416-abbreviations-for-addonss)
	+ Removes `:FOR`, as this thing creates a MM tag no matter `:NEEDS` is satisfied or not.
		- Not exactly needed on this case, but I want to keep things on the clear and prevent people from falling on the same booby trap I felt in.
	+ Closes issue:
		- [#4](https://github.com/TweakScale/Companion_LivingStyle/issues/4) Remove `:FOR` from patches using both `:FOR` and `:NEEDS` for the same name identifier.
* 2021-0919: 0.0.3.0 (LisiasT) for KSP >= 1.2.2
	+ Adds support for:
